Tropical Storm Chedza hit Madagascar today near Morandava with winds between 60 and 70 km/hour. It is moving eastward and currently above our heads in the highlands area at a speed of 9 km/h. Its center is likely to make landfall soon or may have already. Regions in the southwest area are under red alert (meaning imminent danger) and the capital of Antananarivo is under Yellow alert (meaning threat...this is near where we are located, but south of there). As a precaution schools have been closed the last couple days due to risk of flooding. Winds may increase in excess of 90/km/hour over the next 12 hours.

The storm's progress can be monitored at the World Meteorological Organization's website.",low
